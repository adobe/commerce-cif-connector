# GraphQL queries

This folder contains the list of GraphQL queries "generated" by the connector during unit testing. This can help developers understand the types of queries executed by the connector, especially when implementing a 3rd-party integration for another commerce platform.

Due to the limitations of unit testing, we do not guarantee that this list covers all the queries generated by the connector in a real production setup.

The file `graphql-requests.log` is generated automatically by the logger configured in [../logback-test.xml](../logback-test.xml), do NOT edit it manually.
